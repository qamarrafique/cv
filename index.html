  <li><h2>Introduction To Computer </h2></li>
</ul>
<p> A computer system has three main components: hardware, software, and people. The equipment associated with a computer system is called hardware.<br> Software is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. People, however, are the most important component of a computer system - people use the power of the computer for some purpose.<br> In fact, this course will show you that the computer can be a tool for just about anyone from a business person, to an artist, to a housekeeper, to a student - an incredibly powerful and flexible tool.<br>
Software is actually a computer program.<br> To be more specific, a program is a set of step-by-step instructions that directs the computer to do the tasks you want it to do and to produce the results you want. A computer programmer is a person who writes programs.<br> Most of us do not write programs, we use programs written by someone else. This means we are users - people who purchase and use computer software.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Meeting the Machine</h3>
<p>What is a computer?<br> A six-year-old called a computer "radio, movies, and television combined!" <br>A ten-year-old described a computer as "a television set you can talk to." The ten-year-old's definition is closer but still does not recognize the computer as a machine that has the power to make changes.<br>
A computer is a machine that can be programmed to accept data (input), process it into useful information (output), and store it away (in a secondary storage device) for safekeeping or later reuse.<br> The processing of input to output is directed by the software but performed by the hardware.

To function, a computer system requires four main aspects of data handling:<br> input, processing, output, and storage. The hardware responsible for these four areas operates as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input devices accept data in a form that the computer can use; they then send the data to the processing unit.</li>
  <li>The processor, more formally known as the central processing unit (CPU), has the electronic circuitry that manipulates input data into the information people want. The central processing unit executes computer instructions that are specified in the program.</li>
  <li>Output devices show people the processed data-information in a form that they can use.</li>
  <li>Storage usually means secondary storage. Secondary storage consists of devices, such as diskettes, which can store data and programs outside the computer itself. These devices supplement the computer's memory, which, as we will see, can hold data and programs only temporarily.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p>Now let us consider the equipment related to these four aspects of data handling in terms of what you would find on a personal computer.</p>
  <h3>Your Personal Computer Hardware
</h3>

    <td><p>
Let us look at the hardware in terms of a personal computer. Suppose you want to do word processing on a personal computer, using the hardware shown in Figure 1.Word
 processing software allows you to input data such as an essay, save it, revise and re-save it, and print it whenever you wish. The input device, in this case, is a keyboard, which you use to type in the original essay and any changes you want to make to it. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit within the personal computer housing. The central processing unit under the direction of the word processing software accepts the data you input through the keyboard. Processed data from your personal computer is usually output in two forms: on a screen and eventually by a printer. As you key in the essay on the keyboard, it appears on the screen in front of you. After you examine the essay on the screen, make changes, and determine that it is acceptable, you can print the essay on the printer. Your secondary storage device in this case is a diskette, a magnetic medium that stores the essay until it is needed again.
Now we will take a general tour of the hardware needed for input, processing, output, and storage. These same components make up all computer systems, whether small, medium, or large. In this discussion we will try to emphasize the types of hardware you are likely to have seen in your own environment. These topics will be covered in detail in later chapters.</p></td>

<h3>Input: What Goes In</h3>
<p>Input is the data that you put into the computer system for processing.<br> Here are some common ways of feeding input data into the system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Typing on a keyboard. Computer keyboards operate in much the same way as electric typewriter keyboards. <br>The computer responds to what you enter; that is, it "echoes" what you type by displaying it on the screen in front of you.</li>
  <li>Pointing with a mouse. A mouse is a device that is moved by hand over a flat surface.<br> As the ball on its underside rotates, the mouse movement causes corresponding movement of a pointer on the computer screen.<br> Pressing buttons on the mouse lets you invoke commands.</li>

      <td><p>Scanning with a flatbed scanner, wand reader or bar code reader (Figure 3).<br> Flatbed scanners act like a copying machine by using light beams to scan a document or picture that is laid upon its glass face.<br> A great way to send pictures through email! Bar scanners, which you have seen in retail stores, use laser beams to read special letters, numbers, or symbols such as the zebra-striped bar codes on many products.<br>
You can input data to a computer in many other interesting ways, including writing, speaking, pointing, or even by just looking at the data.<br> We will examine all these in detail in a later chapter.

  <h3>The Processor and Memory: Data Manipulation</h3>
  <br>
<p>In a computer the processor is the center of activity.<br> The processor, as we noted, is also called the central processing unit (CPU). <br>The central processing unit consists of electronic circuits that interpret and execute program instructions, as well as communicate with the input, output, and storage devices.<br>
It is the central processing unit that actually transforms data into information.<br> Data is the raw material to be processed by a computer.<br> Such material can be letters, numbers, or facts like grades in a class, baseball batting averages, or light and dark areas in a photograph.<br> Processed data becomes information, data that is organized, meaningful, and useful.<br> In school, for instance, an instructor could enter various student grades (data), which can be processed to produce final grades and perhaps a class average (information).<br> Data that is perhaps uninteresting on its own may become very interesting once it is converted to information.<br> The raw facts (data) about your finances, such as a paycheck or a donation to charity or a medical bill may not be captivating individually, but together, these and other acts can be processed to produce the refund or amount you owe on your income tax return (information).<br>

Computer memory, also known as primary storage, is closely associated with the central processing unit but separate from it.<br> Memory holds the data after it is input to the system and before it is processed; also, memory holds the data after it has been processed but before it has been released to the output device.<br> In addition, memory holds the programs (computer instructions) needed by the central processing unit.</p>
